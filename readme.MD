# Codeworks Assignment

**Build a simple address book app with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery.**

## Summary

As part of my Admission Process for Codeworks' Software Enginnering Intensive Bootcamp, I was challenged to build a simple address book app with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery.

### Latest Updates: 
:white_check_mark: refactored the code to JQuery;  
:white_check_mark: fixed the search bar issues that were preventing the user to retrieve the rest of the search results;  
:white_check_mark: added additional validation rules to the Add Contact form to prevent unintended user inputs to be passed;  
:white_check_mark: added customised validation messages;  
:white_check_mark: added validation rules to display alert messages while editing the contacts;  
:white_check_mark: achieved the desired behavior of adding, editing and deleting contacts, although without fully making use of the Class Contact and its setter methods;  
:white_check_mark: performed a set of adjustments to the interface for better responsive behavior;  
:white_check_mark: deleted unnecessary files.  

### Other keynotes: 

One shall not underestimate the time required to accomplish each task. As a beginner, I had to put the extra effort to go through additional documentation on resources such as :  
  :books: Mozilla;  
  :owl: Khan Academy;  
  :robot: Codecademy;  
  :notebook: Personal Annotations;  
  :arrow_forward: watching tutorials to explore new concepts further and then implement them in the project.

### Special thanks to the explanations on the following Youtube channels: 
1. Traversy Media
2. Web Dev Simplified
3. Code with Bibek
4. CodeWithMark
5. The Providers


**Note to self:** *There is a never-ending range of possibilities to expand the functionalities and optimize features but a WIP today is better than a perfect piece of work that never comes to see the daylight.* :)
