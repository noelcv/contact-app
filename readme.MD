Codeworks Assignment: Build a simple address book app with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery.

As I felt the need to deepen my knowledge on DOM Manipulation, although I had contact and manipulated the DOM with jQuery, I opted for spending most of the time working with Vanilla JS.

While I implemented the Add, Delete functions, I partially implementing an Edit Function. The rows are created and erased dynamically according to the user inputs and instructions to delete the contact. And I say partially, because although I used a Contact class with getters and setters, I couldn't timely finish setting the event to use the setters to update the contacts and/or delete them from the Array.

Other keynotes: One shall not underestimate the time required to accomplish each task. As a beginner, I had to put the extra effort to go through additional documentation on Mozilla, Khan Academy, my annotations on Codecademy and also watching tutorials to explore new concepts further and then implement them in the project.

Special thanks to the explanations on the following Youtube channels:

Code with Bibek

There is a never-ending range of possibilities to expand the functionalities, but an incomplete piece of work today is better than a perfect piece of work that never comes to see the daylight. :)
